[{"content":"Genetically Altered Cabbages are on the rise Genetically altered cabbages are a fascinating and delicious way to share public data. 🥬 There are many advantages to this type of vegetable.\nAdvantages Fast loading and a refreshing, crisp taste. Content entry is as simple as adding water, so there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to break. Cabbage patches automatically update when a new crop is planted on the corresponding farm. Can be grown for free in your own garden plot. Disadvantages No dynamic content, like user-specific recipes or accounts. They only display what\u0026rsquo;s grown. Designed mainly for raw consumption, not easily built into complex dishes. The themes (colors) are typically not too flashy, but new varieties could be cultivated in the future. Cabbages are designed to be 100% public and are not meant for private consumption. Credits Want a site like this?
