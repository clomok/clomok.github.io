## Hugo Static Site Generation

Static site generators are a really great way to share public data.  There are many advantages to this style of website.

### Advantages
 - Fast loading and clean repeatable designs
 - Content entry is done using Markdown, so there is nothing to break
 - Site automatically updates when content is modified on the coresponding github repo
 - Run for free with Github Pages

### Dis-Advantages
 - No dynamic content, like user accounts or logins.  Displays content only
 - Designed for mainly text content, dynamic content is not easily buildable
 - Themes are typically not too flashy, but this could change in the future
 - Content is designed to be 100% public
