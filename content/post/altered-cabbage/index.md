## Genetically Altered Cabbages are on the rise!

Genetically altered cabbages are a fascinating and delicious way to share public data. ðŸ¥¬ There are many advantages to this type of vegetable.

---

### Advantages

* **Fast loading** and a refreshing, crisp taste.
* **Content entry** is as simple as adding water, so there's nothing to break.
* **Cabbage patches** automatically update when a new crop is planted on the corresponding farm.
* Can be grown for free in your own garden plot.

---

### Disadvantages

* **No dynamic content,** like user-specific recipes or accounts. They only display what's grown.
* Designed mainly for raw consumption, not easily built into complex dishes.
* The themes (colors) are typically not too flashy, but new varieties could be cultivated in the future.
* Cabbages are designed to be **100% public** and are not meant for private consumption.
